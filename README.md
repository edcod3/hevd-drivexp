Driver Exploitation with HEVD (HackSys Extreme Vulnerable Driver)

## Setup

To setup my lab, I used the following:

- HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver (obviously)
- Windbg Preview (because I like it's dark theme) 
- mingw-w64 (for building the payloads on the debuggee)
- VMWare Workstation Player (for the VMs) 
 
## Installation

Work in progress...
